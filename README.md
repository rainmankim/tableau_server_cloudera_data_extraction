# tableau_server_cloudera_data_extraction


```

* For easier understanding, I am going to call Tableau Server "Ray's Tableau Server".

This repository will show you the following in the following order:
- (1) Connect Tableau Desktop with Cloudera Hadoop Server
- (2) Extract necessary data (with custom SQL if necessary)
- (3) Publish data source onto "Ray's Tableau Server" with emedded authetification as LIVE data source
- (4) From "Ray's Tabealu Server", change the data from LIVE to EXTRACT  (takes a while)
- (5) Open a new Tableau Desktop instance and connect to the publisehd data source in "Ray's Tableau Server"
```


### Step 1.  Let's open up Tableau Desktop and connect to Cloudera Hadoop with your credentials

### Step 2. Next, connect to Cloudera Table.  And I have written custom SQL query because the DB is too big(You can extract the DB as a whole)

### Step 3. Next, we shall now publish the databse onto "Ray's Tableau Server"

### I recommend publishing this with "Embedded Password" setting with Live connection (because it often fails when you try to extract first)
#### If you choose "prompt user", it will ask for your password every single time. 
#### Alternatively, you can choose to publish as "prompt user" and you can still change to "Embedded Password" in "Ray's Tableau Server".
#### I will show you in step 4

### Step 4. Now let us go to "Ray's Tableau Server".  
#### Search for the published data soruce. 
#### If you had published as "Prompt User", you can change to "Embedded Password" authetification instead.

### (1) Ensure your scripting is enabled on your SAP.

#### You might need to request your IT department to allow this.
### (2) Download Stefan Schnell's SAP Script Recorder.
#### SAP has a built-in recorder. But if you use that you will need to change the syntax to be used in Python.
#### Using Stefan's Recorder generates Python-friendly syntax along with many other powerful features.

## Next, open any Python IDE/code editor. 
## I recommend Jupyter Notebook so that you can slice data in-action.
### Below is an example of recorded scripts which are modified to suit my needs (*for loops + various conditions)

## I have two main functions in my file â€” def sap_automate()  and def enter_data()
### sap_automate(df) is the main function that will establish connection/session and automate log-in
### enter_data(session,df) is a nested function that will execute actions within SAP

## Dealing with Excel
### If you are writing to an existing excel, Pandas library would be not be enough
### Use Excel modules such as xlwings or xlsxwriter
