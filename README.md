# tableau_server_cloudera_data_extraction

* For easier understanding, I am going to call Tableau Server "Ray's Tableau Server".

This repository will show you the following in the following order:
- (1) Connect Tableau Desktop with Cloudera Hadoop Server
- (2) Enter custom SQL to extract necessary data
- (3) Publish data source onto "Ray's Tableau Server" with emedded authetification as LIVE data source
- (4) From "Ray's Tabealu Server", change the data from LIVE to EXTRACT  (takes a while)
- (5) Open a new Tableau Desktop instance and connect to the publisehd data source
```


### Step 1.  Let's open up Tableau Desktop and connect to Cloudera Hadoop with your credentials

## Before starting, I recommend that you prepare two things
### (1) Ensure your scripting is enabled on your SAP.

#### You might need to request your IT department to allow this.
### (2) Download Stefan Schnell's SAP Script Recorder.
#### SAP has a built-in recorder. But if you use that you will need to change the syntax to be used in Python.
#### Using Stefan's Recorder generates Python-friendly syntax along with many other powerful features.

## Next, open any Python IDE/code editor. 
## I recommend Jupyter Notebook so that you can slice data in-action.
### Below is an example of recorded scripts which are modified to suit my needs (*for loops + various conditions)

## I have two main functions in my file â€” def sap_automate()  and def enter_data()
### sap_automate(df) is the main function that will establish connection/session and automate log-in
### enter_data(session,df) is a nested function that will execute actions within SAP

## Dealing with Excel
### If you are writing to an existing excel, Pandas library would be not be enough
### Use Excel modules such as xlwings or xlsxwriter
