Hi,  my name is Ray Kim. I am here to share my experience in SAP automation. 
I am the furtherest thing from an expert but I hope my codes can help you.
You can contact me at rainmankim@gmail.com for further assistance.

This repository will explain how you can automate SAP log-in and execute T-code.
If you can do that, you can easily figure out the rest, using Stefan's recorder.
I am keeping things simple here to avoid confusion

In this use-case, I am not using PyAutoGui or OpenCV.
Those things can be used by all means.
But Stefan's recorder shortens development time for SAP automation at zero cost.
```


## Before starting, I recommend that you prepare two things
### (1) Ensure your scripting is enabled on your SAP.

#### You might need to request your IT department to allow this.
### (2) Download Stefan Schnell's SAP Script Recorder.
#### SAP has a built-in recorder. But if you use that you will need to change the syntax to be used in Python.
#### Using Stefan's Recorder generates Python-friendly syntax along with many other powerful features.

## Next, open any Python IDE/code editor. 
## I recommend Jupyter Notebook so that you can slice data in-action.
### Below is an example of recorded scripts which are modified to suit my needs (*for loops + various conditions)

## I have two main functions in my file — def sap_automate()  and def enter_data()
### sap_automate(df) is the main function that will establish connection/session and automate log-in
### enter_data(session,df) is a nested function that will execute actions within SAP

## Dealing with Excel
### If you are writing to an existing excel, Pandas library would be not be enough
### Use Excel modules such as xlwings or xlsxwriter
